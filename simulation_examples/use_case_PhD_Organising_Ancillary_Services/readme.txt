Dear reader,
hear you find the original scripts and input data for the use case simulations of the PhD Thesis ‘Organising Ancillary Services for Electric Power Systems’. 
The PhD calculations have been executed in 2019. Due to a long review process, the model has been further improved, some bugs were 
removed and the ASAM was published before the PhD Thesis.
This means that recalculating the PhD use-case scenario’s with the latest version of ASAM will deliver different results.
