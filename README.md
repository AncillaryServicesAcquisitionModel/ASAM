Ancillary Services Acquisition Model (ASAM) - Agent-based model to simulate processes of ancillary services acquisition and electricity markets.

The model is described in the following publication: *Ancillary Services Acquisition Model: considering market interactions in policy design*.

Preprint is available at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13047). The paper is published in the journal [Applied Energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117697).
Please use this publication also for citing the model.

The underlying mental model and a detailed description of the strategies of market party agents in ASAM can be found in this [PhD Thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367478969_Organising_Ancillary_Services_for_Electric_Power_Systems) (section 5.1 and 5.2). 

See for further documentation the ASAM [wiki](https://github.com/AncillaryServicesAcquisitionModel/ASAM/wiki).

Furthermore, there is a [discussion section](https://github.com/AncillaryServicesAcquisitionModel/ASAM/discussions) for questions, ideas and collaboration.
