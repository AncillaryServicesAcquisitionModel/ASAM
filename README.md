# ASAM
Ancillary Services Acquisition Model (ASAM) - Agent-based model to simulate processes of ancillary services acquisition and electricity markets.

The model is described in the following publication:
Ancillary Services Acquisition Model: considering market interactions in policy design.

Preprint on is available at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13047). Please use this publication also for citing the model.

A detailed description of the strategies of market party agents in ASAM can be found in this [preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351548505_Ancillary_Services_Acquisition_Model_heuristic_agent_strategies) 

See for further documentation the ASAM [wiki](https://github.com/AncillaryServicesAcquisitionModel/ASAM/wiki)

Furthermore, there is a [discussion section](https://github.com/AncillaryServicesAcquisitionModel/ASAM/discussions) for questions, ideas and collaboration.
